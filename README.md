### Data
We have shared the NESTFUL evaluation set under `data` dir.
- `executable`: contains data and spec with necessary information to execute them through RapidAPI.
- `non-executable`: contains the nested sequencing data from SGD and GLAIVE that are hand-picked by human annotators from data synthetically generated using an LLM.
